We are creating an application to track movies. We have  studios, which have movies, and movies have several actors, and actors can be in several movies.
Read each story carefully.


Story 1
As a user,
When I visit the studio index page
I see a list of all of the movie studios
And underneath each studio, I see the names of all of its movies.
Story 2
As a user,
When I visit an actor's show page,
I see their name, their age, and a list of the names of all of the movies they are in.


Story 3
As a user,
When I visit a movie's show page.
I see the movie's name, creation year, and genre,
and a list of all its actors from youngest to oldest.
And I see the average age of all of the movie's actors


Story 4
As a user,
When I visit a movie show page,
I see a form for an actors name
and when I fill in the form with an existing actor's name
I am redirected back to that movie's show page
And I see the actor's name listed
(This should not break story 3, You do not have to test for a sad path)


Story 5
As a user,
When I visit an actor's show page
I see a unique list of all of the actors this particular actor has worked with.
